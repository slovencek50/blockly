#summary Information about Boolean logic blocks.

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Introduction =

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra Boolean algebra] is a mathematical system that has two values:
 * *true*
 * *false*

Boolean values (also called _conditions_) are used in these control block, which contain examples::
 * [IfElse conditional blocks]
 * [Loops#repeat repeat blocks]

One of the many examples from those pages is:

http://blockly.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/if-else.png

If the value of the variable *x* is greater than 100, the condition is *true*, and the text "What a big number!" is printed.  If the value of *x* is not greater than 100, the condition is *false*, and "That's not very big." is printed.

Boolean values can also be stored in variables and passed to procedures, the same as number, text, and list values.

= Blocks =

If a block expects a Boolean value as an input, it interprets an absent input as *false*.  An example is provided below.  Non-Boolean values cannot be directly plugged in where Boolean values are expected, although it is possible (but inadvisable) to store a non-Boolean value in a variable, then plug that into the input.  Neither of these practices are recommended, and their behavior could change in future versions of Blockly.

== Values ==

A single block, with a dropdown specifying either *true* or *false*, can be used to get a boolean value:

== not ==

The *not* block converts its Boolean input into its opposite.  For example, the result of:

https://blockly.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/boolean-not-true.png

is false.

As mentioned above, if no input is provided, a value of *true* is assumed, so the following block produces the value *false*:

Leaving an input empty is not recommended, however.
