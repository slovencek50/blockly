Did you just get this error message?

If so, then you are probably attempting to run the uncompiled version of Blockly and you are missing the dependency on [https://developers.google.com/closure/library/ Closure Library].

== Getting Closure ==

Getting Closure is quick and easy.  Use Subversion to checkout a copy from [https://code.google.com/p/closure-library/source/checkout Closure's repository]:

{{{
svn checkout https://closure-library.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ closure-library-read-only
}}}

Alternatively, you can [https://code.google.com/p/closure-library/downloads/list download an archive] from Closure and unzip it.

Either way, once you have the Closure files, place them next to Blocky's root directory and ensure that the directory is named `closure-library-read-only`.  This is the directory structure you want:

That's it.  Blockly should now work in uncompiled mode.
