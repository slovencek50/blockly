#summary Documentation of control loop blocks for translators and users.

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Introduction and Terminology =

The *Control* category holds blocks that control whether other blocks placed in their _body_ are run.  There are two types of control blocks: IfElse (described on their own page) and these, which control how many times the _body_ is run and, in some cases, the value of a variable used within the body.  These structures are called _loops_, since the body is repeated (possibly) multiple times, reminiscent of a rope containing loops.    Each pass through the loop is called an _iteration_.  (How about our using the term "pass"?)

== Conditionals ==

Although a type of control statement, IfElse blocks are covered on their own page.

== Repeat ==

The "repeat" block runs the code in its body the specified number of times.  For example, the following block will print "Hello!" ten times.
