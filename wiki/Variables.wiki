= Introduction =

We use the term _variable_ the same as it is used in mathematics and in other programming languages: a named value that can be changed (varies).  Variables are used in several places:
 * Every *count with* and *for each* block uses a variable and defines its values.  These values can only be used within the block.
 * They are also used when passing values to a procedure (user-defined block).  These values can only be used within the procedure.
 * Users may create new variables at any time.  These values can be used anywhere in the program.

The same variable can hold different types of values -- numbers, booleans, text, or lists -- at different times.

== Dropdown menu ==

Clicking on a variable's dropdown symbol (triangle) gives the following menu:

The menu provides the following options.
 * the names of all variables defined in the program.
 * "Rename variable...", which changes the name of this variable wherever it appears in the program.  Selecting this opens a small window that prompts the user for the new name with the text: "Rename all %1 variables to:", where %1 is replaced by the old name (here "item").
 * "New variable...", which enables the user to enter a new name for the variable, without replacing or changing variables with the old name (here "item").  Selecting this opens a small window that prompts the user for the new name with the text "New variable name:".
