=The *If Then* Block=

To access the *If Then* Block, click *Control*.

|| *Option* || *Description* ||
|| *if* || Finds out if something is true. If it is, the program will do whatever you tell it to do next.||
|| *then* ||Useful with a block like *move forward*, that tells the program what to do next.||
|| *else if* || Useful for combining more than one *If Then* sentences.||
|| *else* ||Useful for the last sentence in the block, to tell the program what to do even if there's a case you haven't thought of.||

*Tip*: To make useful sentences, combine the *If Then* block with these other blocks:

 * [Wall Wall]
 * [Move Move]
 * [Turn Turn]

You can write statements like:

 * If *wall ahead? * then *move backward*.
 * Else if *wall to the right?* then *turn left*. (Hint: In real life, this sentence might not work the way you think.)
 * Else *move forward*.

Your *If Then* block should always follow the format:

 * If *this thing * then *do this*.
 * Else if *this other thing* then *do something else*.
 * Else *do that*.

*Note*: You should always include the last *Else* to make sure the program does something even if there is a case you haven't thought of.
