#summary Running, modifying, and adding unit tests

After changing or adding code, you should run existing unit tests and consider writing more.

= Running unit tests =
 # Load `tests/generators/index.html` in a browser.
 # Choose the relevant part of the system to test from the drop-down menu, and click "Load".  Blocks should appear in the workspace.
 # Click on "!JavaScript".
 # Copy and run the generated code in a !JavaScript console.  If the output ends with "OK", the test has passed.
 # Click on "Python".
 # Copy and run the generated code in a Python interpreter.  If the output ends with "OK", the test has passed.

= Modifying or creating unit tests =
 # Load `tests/generators/index.html` in a browser.
 # Choose the relevant part of the system from the drop-down menu, and click "Load".  Blocks should appear in the workspace.
 # Make any changes or additions to the blocks.
 # Click on "XML".
 # Copy the generated XML into the appropriate file in `tests/generators/`.
