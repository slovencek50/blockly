<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

= Introduction =

As in everyday speech, a Blockly list is an ordered collection of items, such as a "to do" list or a shopping list.  Items in a list may be of any type, and the same value may appear more than once in a list.

== create empty list ==

The simplest list is the empty list, which is created with the *create empty list* block:

== create list with ==

The *create list with* block allows the user to specify the initial values in a new list.  In this example, a list of words is being created and placed in a variable named *letters*:

For this document, we'll denote this list as ["alpha", "beta", "gamma"], and we will refer below to the variables defined in this section.

This shows the creation of a list of numbers:

This creates a list of colours:

It is less common, but possible, to create a list with values of different types:

== create list with item ==

The *create list with item* block lets you create a list that has the specified number of copies of an item.  For example, the following blocks set the variable *words* to the list containing ["very", "very", "very"].
