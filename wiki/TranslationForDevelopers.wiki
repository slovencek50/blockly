#summary Information about translation for Blockly developers

This document provides what developers should know about Blockly translations.  Translators should read [https://code.google.com/p/blockly/wiki/Translation this document] instead.

= Introduction =

Internationalization (i18n) is one of Blockly's top priorities.  See, for example, [https://neil.fraser.name/news/2013/03/16/ CS in VN].  We are proud to have support for right-to-left and left-to-right scripts and that the [http://blockly-demo.appspot.com/static/apps/puzzle/index.html Puzzle application] has been translated into over 50 languages but will not be satisfied until all of Blockly has been.

= !TranslateWiki =
We use [http://www.translatewiki.net TranslateWiki] as our translation console and translator community.  We provide them with the following files:
  * *qqq.json*, mapping message names to _message documentation_ (information for translators).
  * *en.json*, mapping message names to the English-language text.  Note that we use Canadian English.
  * *_LANG_.json*, mapping message names to the appropriate language text.  Messages that have not been translated to the given language will not be present in this file.
_LANG_ is (loosely) an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag IETF language tag], such as "de" for German or "pt-br" for Brazilian Portuguese.

Here are links to files for translating the tutorials and applications:
  * [https://code.google.com/p/blockly/source/browse/trunk/apps/qqq.json apps/qqq.json]
  * [https://code.google.com/p/blockly/source/browse/trunk/apps/en.json apps/en.json]
  * [https://code.google.com/p/blockly/source/browse/trunk/apps/de.json apps/de.json] (as one example of a language file).

= Applications and Tutorials =

== Soy-based translation ==

The Blockly applications and tutorials (henceforth referred to as "apps") are built with "Soy", also known as [https://developers.google.com/closure/templates/ Google Closure templates], which has [https://developers.google.com/closure/templates/docs/translation translation tools].  Specifically, all messages appear in files whose name ends with the "soy" extension.   Messages used by multiple apps are defined in [https://code.google.com/p/blockly/source/browse/trunk/apps/common.soy apps/common.soy], and have the prefix "Apps."  Messages used by only a single app are defined in that app's template.soy file, such as [https://code.google.com/p/blockly/source/browse/trunk/apps/maze/template.soy apps/maze/template.soy] and prefixed with the name of the application, such as "Maze.".

=== The msg tag ===
Here is an example of a message definition:

{{{
{msg meaning="Maze.moveForward" 
     desc="block text - Imperative or infinitive of a verb for a person moving 
           (walking) in the direction he/she is facing."}
  move forward
{/msg}
}}}

Notes:
  * The key is defined through the "meaning" attribute: "Maze.moveForward".
  * The message documentation for the translator is defined through the "desc" attribute.  This appears as the value in the qqq.json file.
  * The English language text appears between the "msg" start and end tags.  This appears as the value in the en.json file.
 
A left brace or right brace can be included in an attribute value by using double braces to introduce and close the "msg" tags and writing "{lb}" [left brace] for "{" or "{rb}" for "}", as in this definition:

{{{
{{msg meaning="Puzzle.country1Language" 
      desc="The English language.{lb}{lb}Identical|English{rb}{rb}"}}
  English
{{/msg}}
}}}
(The !TranslateWiki "Identical" tag is shrouded in mystery.  It was added to a Blockly file by a !TranslateWiki wizard, and I was told not to worry about why.)

=== Placement of the msg tag ===

==== Messages used only once within a template ====

If a message is used only once and the use is within the template, it can be defined where it is used:

{{{
<button class="notext" 
        title="{msg meaning="Apps.codeTooltip" 
                    desc="tooltip (pop-up help) for button; pressing the button causes a program in the
                          JavaScript computer language to be displayed, based on the program created by the user."}
                 See generated JavaScript code.
            {/msg}" 
        onclick="BlocklyApps.showCode(this);">
  <img src="../../media/1x1.gif" class="code icon21">
</button>
}}}


==== Messages referenced from !JavaScript files====
If a message is used from another file, such as maze.js or blocks.js, it must be declared within a span:

{{{
    <span id="Maze_moveForward">
      {msg meaning="Maze.moveForward" 
           desc="block text - Imperative or infinitive of a verb for a person moving 
               (walking) in the direction he/she is facing."}
        move forward
      {/msg}
    </span>
}}}
By convention, the id of the span is the same as the "meaning" key but replaces periods with underscores.  The message is referenced from code through the method {{{BlocklyApps.getMsg()}}}, as in the example below from [https://code.google.com/p/blockly/source/browse/trunk/apps/maze/blocks.js apps/maze/blocks.js]:

{{{
Blockly.Language.maze_moveForward = {
  // Block for moving forward.  [A portion of the following code is omitted.]
  init: function() {
    this.setColour(290);
    this.appendDummyInput()
        .appendTitle(BlocklyApps.getMsg('Maze_moveForward'));
  }
};
}}}

==== Messages used multiple times====
If a message is used multiple times within one or multiple template files, all "msg" tags should have the same "meaning" attribute and enclosed text, but only one should have the real description as the "desc" attribute.  The others should have "IBID" (case-insensitive).

If a message is used in more than one app, it should be defined within a span in [https://code.google.com/p/blockly/source/browse/trunk/apps/common.soy apps/common.soy], and its meaning should be prefixed with "Apps.".  For example, common.soy includes:

{{{
<span id="blocklyMessage">
  {msg meaning="Apps.blocklyMessage" 
         desc="The project name.  If readers of your language would know approximately how to pronounce 'Blockly', 
               leave unchanged.  Otherwise, include a transliteration in parentheses, such as the Russian:
               'Blockly (\u0411\u043bo\u043a\u043b\u0438)'."}
     Blockly
  {/msg}
</span>
}}}

Here is a sample use from [https://code.google.com/p/blockly/source/browse/trunk/apps/turtle/template.soy apps/turtle/template.soy]:
{{{
<a href="../index.html">{msg meaning="Apps.blocklyMessage" desc="IBID"}Blockly{/msg}</a>
}}}
