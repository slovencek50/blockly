= Introduction =

We use the term _variable_ the same as it is used in mathematics and in other programming languages: a named value that can be changed (varies).  Variables can be created in several different ways.
 * Every *count with* and *for each* block uses a variable and defines its values.  These values can only be used within the block.  A traditional computer science term for these are [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_variable loop variables].
 * User-defined functions (also known as "procedures") can define inputs, which creates variables that can be used only within the function.  These are traditionally called "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter parameters]" or "arguments".
 * Users may create variables at any time through the "set" block.  These are traditionally called "[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_variables global variables]".
Blockly does not support [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_variable  local variables].

== Dropdown menu ==

Clicking on a variable's dropdown symbol (triangle) gives the following menu:

The menu provides the following options.
 * the names of all variables defined in the program.
 * "Rename variable...", which changes the name of this variable wherever it appears in the program.  Selecting this opens a small window that prompts the user for the new name with the text: "Rename all %1 variables to:", where %1 is replaced by the old name (here "item").
 * "New variable...", which enables the user to enter a new name for the variable, without replacing or changing variables with the old name (here "item").  Selecting this opens a small window that prompts the user for the new name with the text "New variable name:".
