=The *And Or* Block=

To access the *And Or* Block, click *Logic*.

|| *Option* || *Description* ||
|| *and* || Place this between two blocks to make the program do something whenever both conditions exist at the same time. Example: In the Maze program, you might want your player to move forward whenever there are walls on both sides. To do this, use *wall to the right?* and *wall to the left?*.||
|| *or* ||Place this between two blocks when you want the program to do something whenever at least one of the conditions exist.||

*Note*: The *And Or* block fits with blocks that it might not be useful with. For example, it fits with the *True* block.
